# 🌰 Kastan

Personal learning project inspired by [metarhia/impress](https://github.com/metarhia/impress).  
This project is intended for educational purposes and experimentation with building a lightweight **Node.js application server**.  

Most of the features are built on top of my other library, [uncommon-js](https://github.com/leonid-shutov/uncommon-js), which provides a custom module system based on code sandboxing using V8 isolated contexts.

## 📂 Examples

Usage examples can be found in the [example folder](https://github.com/leonid-shutov/kastan/tree/master/example).
